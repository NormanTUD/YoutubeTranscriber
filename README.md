# YoutubeTranscriber
This script allows to download the automatically generated subtitles from YouTube and parses them in a nice way

# How to use this

> perl parse.pl YoutubeID

This automatically downloads the captions from YouTube and parses them so that you have timestamps once every minute
and can more easily find special positions in videos.

# What you need

You need to have youtube-dl installed for this. 

# Examples

Check the `results`-folder for examples. See the youtube-videos (you can get them via the id in the filename)
for the original videos.
